- Transform the dataset: Clean and process data using Data Preview, Power Query and DAX

## Summary
- Focus on skincare: Itâ€™s the best-performing category across volume, revenue, and efficiency.
- Review suppliers: Long lead and manufacturing times suggest need for renegotiation or diversification.
- Optimize carriers and routes: Shift volume from Carrier A to B if service level agreements (SLAs) allow.
- Investigate cosmetics costing: With shortest lead time but highest unit cost, review production and sourcing strategies for potential savings.
