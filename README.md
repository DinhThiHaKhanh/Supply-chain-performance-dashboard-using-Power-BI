# Supply chain performance dashboard using Power BI
## Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize supply chain performance of a Fashion and Beauty startup through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard helps business stakeholders monitor key metrics related to product sales, customer behavior, inventory, shipping performance, and manufacturing costs.
Objective: Provide actionable insights to optimize supply chain efficiency, reduce costs, and improve product availability.
## Business Context
In a fast-paced supply chain environment (e.g., FMCG or retail), companies face challenges such as:
- Fluctuating product demand
- High shipping costs
- Delays in delivery or manufacturing
This project addresses these issues through data-driven performance analysis across key areas.
## Tools Used
- Power BI: For dashboard creation and data visualization
- Excel/CSV: Source of raw supply chain data
## Dataset's features
- Product Type
- SKU
- Price
- Availability
- Number of products sold
- Revenue generated
- Customer demographics
- Stock levels
- Lead times
- Order quantities
- Shipping times
- Shipping carriers
- Shipping costs
- Supplier name
- Location
- Lead time
- Production volumes
- Manufacturing lead time
- Manufacturing costs
- Inspection results
- Defect rates
- Transportation modes
- Routes
- Costs
## Work flow
- Import data to Power BI
- Explore the dataset: Look through the columns to understand data's structure and contents
- Transform the dataset: Clean and process data using Data Preview, Power Query and DAX
- Analyze the dataset: Ask questions to filter hightlight information
- Visualization: Create visualizations to assist key findings
- Report making: Interpret the results and give informed decisions for the company
## Business questions
- For Sales:
  - Which product category has the highest volumn and revenue?
  - Who is the company's target customer for the highest revenue product category?
- For Transportation:
  - Which transportation mode is mostly used?
  - Which carrier is the most effective in terms of cost and shipping time?
- For Manufacturing:
  - In terms of manufacturing lead time, which product category has the longest lead time?
  - For time-sensitive SKUs, which supplier is the most efficient?
- For Total lead time and cost:
  - Give conclusion about each category's lead time and cost
## Summary
- Focus on skincare: Itâ€™s the best-performing category across volume, revenue, and efficiency.
- Review suppliers: Long lead and manufacturing times suggest need for renegotiation or diversification.
- Optimize carriers and routes: Shift volume from Carrier A to B if service level agreements (SLAs) allow.
- Investigate cosmetics costing: With shortest lead time but highest unit cost, review production and sourcing strategies for potential savings.
